This script scrapes data from an Arbitrum DEX dashboard, processes it, calculates indicators, and creates visual summaries using Matplotlib. 
The goal is to periodically check the metrics of the perpetual DEX protocol.

Future Improvements:

- Server Hosting: Explore hosting options for continuous monitoring.
- Scheduled Execution: Set up automated script runs at intervals.
- Data Logging: Enhance to log and track data changes over time.
